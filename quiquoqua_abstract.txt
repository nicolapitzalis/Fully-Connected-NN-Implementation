In this project, we built a fully-connected feed-forward Neural Network, exploring different Gradient Descent algorithm variations. To find the best model for the ML-CUP23 competition, we conducted an extensive grid search over the neural network's settings using k-fold cross-validation. The chosen model is an ensemble of the top 10 performers, assessed through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure.
