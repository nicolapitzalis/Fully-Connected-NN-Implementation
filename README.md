# Fully connected Feed-forward Neural Network for regression and binary classification
The repository consists of a fully-connected feed-forward Neural Network, with different Gradient Descent algorithm variations. To get the best model for the ML-CUP23 competition, it has been conducted an extensive grid search over the neural network's settings using k-fold cross-validation. The chosen model is an ensemble of the top 10 performers, assessed through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure.

Required packages are located in the requirements.txt file. To install just execute "pip install -r requirements.txt"
